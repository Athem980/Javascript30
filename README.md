# Javascript30

This repository contains 30 interactive web projects developed as part of the "JavaScript30" challenge. The challenge focuses on building small, functional projects using plain JavaScript, without the assistance of libraries or frameworks. Through these projects, I gained significant experience in DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.
